# Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL
I created a presentation for the business managers of Rockbuster Stealth, an Excel file for my technical colleagues containing my SQL queries that I wrote and the data outputs, and prepared a data dictionary.

##  Objective
![image](https://github.com/DawnChism/Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL/assets/157734176/5e9d3c5c-f309-4ee8-857f-5ae2e42b4cc6)

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
